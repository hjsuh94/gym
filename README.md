# OpenAI Gym 

This is my personal fork of [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) that I maintain for variuos new environments, relevant for research in pixel-based control. These environments will include:
- [Carrot pushing environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09093.pdf) for manipulating piles of objects 
- Gym environments wrapped around [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/)
- Modifications to existing [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environments where observations are directly pixels.

Some of these environments will be exported to a pip package once they are mature.
